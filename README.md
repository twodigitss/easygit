# Gitngo
## A Rust tool to make your git workflow less repetitive.
Despite the name, <strong>Git'n'go</strong> is a small command-line utility written in RustÂ© to commit changes quickly without worring about the rest of the process.
Normally you would have to add everything, type a title for the commit and then pushing to a branch.
<strong>Save 60% of the effort</strong> by just typing a commit message and you are done!

Initializing repositories is also quick, if you want a project to be initialized and uploaded to an existing github repository, you just have to type the url of your github repository when prompted and everything you had will be saved and ready to quick - git more changes (:
